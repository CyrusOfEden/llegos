## Quick Start Guide

Read through the `tests/` folder, it has examples with lots of comments showcasing Llegos' flexibility.

## Core Concepts

Llegos is built upon several foundational elements that work together to enable complex interactions and behaviors within multi-agent systems. Here's an overview of the key concepts that form the backbone of Llegos:

### Objects
- **Definition:** Objects are the fundamental entities in Llegos, defined using Pydantic models. They represent the base class from which other more specialized entities like Messages and Actors derive.
- **Customization:** Users can extend the Object class to create their own scene objects, complete with validation and serialization capabilities.

### Messages
- **Purpose:** Messages serve as the primary means of communication between agents. They carry information, requests, commands, or any data that needs to be transmitted from one entity to another.
- **Structure and Handling:** Each message has an identifiable structure and is designed to be flexible and extensible. The system provides mechanisms for message validation, forwarding, replying, and tracking within conversation threads.
- **Tree Structure:** Messages follow email semantics. They are organized into hierarchical trees, allowing for the creation of complex communication patterns and protocols. Multiple replies can be sent to a single message, and each reply can have its own set of replies, and so on.

### Actors
- **Roles:** Actors are specialized objects that represent autonomous agents within the system. Each actor has its unique behavior, state, and communication abilities.
- **Interactions:** Actors interact with each other and the environment primarily through strongly-typed messages, responding to received information and making decisions based on their internal logic and objectives.

### Scenes
- **Contextual Containers:** Scenes act as containers or contexts in which actors operate and interact. They define the boundaries and properties of the environment that the agents are situated in.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** Scenes can be nested, allowing for the creation of complex, multi-layered environments where different groups of actors can interact within their sub-contexts.
