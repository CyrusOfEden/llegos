ðŸš€ Big news! We're thrilled to unveil the alpha release of Llegos, a groundbreaking Python DSL for designing multi-agent systems. It's a whole new way to build and interact with these systems.

"More of a PyTorch, less of a Keras"

Here's Llegos in a nutshell: llegos.Actors are containers for your agents, and llegos.Actors send llegos.Messages and share llegos.Objects in llegos.Scenes.

Here's @CyrusOfEden, the man behind Llegos, and @karan4d, cofounder of Nous, to tell you more about it.

Let's dive into what makes Llegos a game-changer.

First up, Strongly Typed Message Passing - ensuring clarity and precision in communication between your agents. It's all about making complex interactions simpler and more reliable.

Next, we've got Email-like Messaging Semantics. This means your messages in Llegos are as intuitive as using email - with functionalities like replying and forwarding. Who knew agent communication could be this straightforward?

Here's a big one: Bring Your Own Libraries. Llegos seamlessly integrates with tools like Langchain, LlamaIndex, Outlines, DSPy... You name it! Enhance your agents and coordinate them in a multi-agent system with ease.

Flexibility and generalizability are at the core of Llegos. The core primitives allow you to model agent hierarchies, networks, and more. It's a whole new way to think about multi-agent systems.
