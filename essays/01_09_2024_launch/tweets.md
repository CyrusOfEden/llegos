Let's dive into what makes Llegos a game-changer.

First up, Strongly Typed Message Passing - ensuring clarity and precision in communication between your agents. It's all about making complex interactions simpler and more reliable.

Next, we've got Email-like Messaging Semantics. This means your messages in Llegos are as intuitive as using email - with functionalities like replying and forwarding. Who knew agent communication could be this straightforward?

Flexibility and generalizability are at the core of Llegos. The core primitives allow you to model agent hierarchies, networks, and more. It's a whole new way to think about multi-agent systems.
