We're thrilled to announce the alpha release of Llegos, a domain specific library for designing multi-agent systems in Python led by @CyrusofEden.

Llegos in a nutshell: llegos.Actors are containers for your agents, and llegos.Actors send llegos.Messages and share llegos.Objects in llegos.Networks.

Described by an early contributor as "More of a PyTorch, less of a Keras"

Let's dive into what makes Llegos a game-changer.

First, Strongly Typed Message Passing - ensuring clarity and precision in communication between your agents. Llegos focuses on making complex interactions simpler and more reliable.

Next, Email-like Messaging Semantics. Messages in Llegos are as intuitive as using email - with functionalities like replying and forwarding.

Bring Your Own Libraries. Llegos seamlessly integrates with tools like Langchain, LlamaIndex, Outlines, DSPy...modularity is vital.
Enhance your agents and coordinate them in a multi-agent system with ease.

Flexibility and generalizability are at the core of Llegos. The core primitives allow you to model agent hierarchies, networks, and more.
