# Llegos: A strongly-typed Python DSL for multi-agent systems

*"More of a PyTorch, less of a Keras", "More of a FastAPI, less of a Django"*

We're excited to unveil the alpha release of Llegos, a Python DSL to catalyze innovation in multi-agent systems research and development.

## Exploring the Design Space of Multi-Agent Systems with Llegos

Recent advances in multi-agent systems have opened up a world of possibilities for developers. But with these new opportunities come new challenges. How do you design a multi-agent system that's flexible, adaptable, and scalable? How do you ensure that your system can handle the complexity of real-world interactions?

We recognize that we're still early in the journey of multi-agent systems. And we believe that Llegos can help us navigate this uncharted territory. By providing a new paradigm for conceptualizing and implementing multi-agent interactions, Llegos empowers developers to explore the design space of multi-agent systems and create innovative solutions to complex problems.

Existing approaches offer a limited view of multi-agent systems. They focus on specific implementations of multi-agent systems, rather than providing a framework for building multi-agent systems. Existing research focuses on specific implementations of multi-agent systems rather than providing a framework for expressing multi-agent systems.

Llegos aspires to be a catalyst for innovation in multi-agent systems. By providing an expressive DSL, Llegos empowers developers with elegant building blocks to forge their own paths in the design space of multi-agent systems. This flexibility is crucial in a field as dynamic and diverse as multi-agent systems, where one size seldom fits all, and best practices have yet to be discovered.

Whether it's simulating complex ecosystems, orchestrating intricate interactions, or developing advanced coordination protocols, Llegos provides the foundational elements and freedom necessary for such endeavors. It's paint, not paintings.

## Key Features of Llegos

0. **Simple, made easy:** The whole API can can be conceptually grokked with the mnemonic **"llegos.Actors send llegos.Messages and share llegos.Objects in llegos.Scenes."**

1. **Strongly typed message passing:** At the heart of Llegos is its use of pedantic models for message passing. This ensures precision and clarity in communication, allowing for dynamically generated, well-structured messages crucial for complex multi-agent interactions.

2. **Messaging with email semantics** Llegos introduces an intuitive, email-like messaging system. Messages have parents, enabling functionalities like replying and forwarding, which enhances clarity and traceability in the system's communication.

3. **Bring your own libraries:** Whether that's Langchain, LlamaIndex, CamelAI, transformers... use Llegos Actors to elevate your agents into a multi-agent system, and coordinate them using a Scene.

4. **Flexibility and generalizability:** Llegos Scenes are themselves Actors, and can be nested within each other. This allows for the creation of complex, multi-layered environments where different groups of actors can interact within their sub-contexts.

## FAQ

**Q: What sets Llegos apart from other multi-agent systems like AutoGen, CamelAI, and ChatDev?**

A: Llegos is unique in that it facilitates the exploration of the multi-agent system design space. Unlike specific implementations, Llegos provides a framework for building multi-agent systems, rather than confining you to pre-built paradigms.

**Q: How does Llegos interact with libraries like Langchain, LlamaIndex, Outlines, DSPy, Instructor?**

A: Llegos is designed to be flexible and generalizable, not tied to any specific way of using LLMs. You can integrate any combination of libraries in the implementation of your Llegos Actors, in any order you choose.

## The Future of Llegos

The alpha release is just the beginning of our journey with Llegos. As the community grows and the project evolves, we look forward to expanding its capabilities and integrating user feedback.

We're particularly excited to work with explorers like you to discover new ways of using Llegos. We believe that Llegos can be a catalyst for innovation in multi-agent systems, and we're excited to see what you create with it.
